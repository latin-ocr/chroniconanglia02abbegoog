From hence proceeded that great prince, whose power
Banish‘d the pope’s usurp'd supremacy3
Under whose ssags the¹ German emperor
Serv‘d as a soldier: hence that majesty
Under whose peaceful rule this fruitful isle
Enjoys sweet plenty and tranquillity
Is issued; he that first enjoyed the style

Off Britain's monafch ; ¹ for as Henry join’d

The reses, so this prinee the realms combin’d.

Now aged Waynflete looks for death, who ssies
Like Perseus' mounted on his winged steed,
Whom, ere his venom’d arrows touch, he dies,
And thou receiv‘d'st fair warning, and dost seed
His ravenous darts. He now draws nigh, and thou
Distributing thy wealth, whose loss did breed
A double gain, art now prepar'd, even now

To entermin death's message: thy soul ssies

With purified wings up to the azure skies*

159.
There with heaven's citizens thou liv'st in bliss,
Which shall no kind of intermissiou feel ;
There no tyrannio smile, no serpent‘s hiss
Disturb thy rest3 no murderer bathes his steel
In guiltless blood ς there dost thou shine with them
That safely scorn blind fortune’s powerful wheel.
