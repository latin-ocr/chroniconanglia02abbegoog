20 Pam Hflnm’s

Of Pyrrha and Deucalion stay'd ; Ι never
Dipp’d my light pen in the Castalian ink.
⁸ I never saw Pyrene, yet had liever
Into the choking earth’s big belly sink
(O holy Pope) than not thy worth confess
Which didst thy love to Pnets so express.

35.
Thou gav'st two hundred crowns for every book
Of that Greek poet for whose birth long after
Seven cities strove,⁷ whose works were ne'er forsook
By that first Grecian monarch, who through wateir
And sire pursued the Persians ; to be brought
In Latin verses ; that this work though latter
Might smooth the former. Thy love always sought
To make itself known to such men, whose quill
Could pain a passion, though (if meanly) ill.

36.

Thou, being told that some who dwelt at Rome
Could smoothly pen and speech, marvel‘st, and said,
“ Surely they cannot, if they could they'd come
To me for patronage, who am well assay'd
With meaner stuff.'¹ Brave prolate! let thy name
(Since thou so long hast low in grave been laid)
Be made immortal by some man of fame,

Who fitIy may in bravo heroic verse

Blaze out thy deeds, immortalize thy hearse.
