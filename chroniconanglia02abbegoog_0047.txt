How well he did perform that place this story
Shall shortly tell ; while thus he climbs the throne

Than Waynssete to succeed him? Henry knew
His scholamhip sufficient, and his wit
To manage high affairs so great, that few
Could equalise it. He his saith had prov'dz

Honouring his Prince, was of his Pn'nce belov'd,
Who therefore to the Convent wrote that he
By their electior] might their Bishop be.

Οἱ the commended so prevailed, that they

With fit congruity of voice and spirit

Elected Waynssete, and did so obey

Their Prince‘s will, and made themselves most blest
With a renown'd Prelfl‘te, that to this day

That Church may vaunt her hap, and never rest
