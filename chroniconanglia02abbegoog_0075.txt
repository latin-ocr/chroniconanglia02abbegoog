Christened Sir Thomas Gresham’s ⁵ worthy frame,
Thau which a ἰαίνει· bul-se was never seen,
So royal Henxy named this stately place,
Thau which a fairer never yet hath been,
⁶ Magdalen College, surely worth the grace

Of such a namer, since the world can boast

Of no such college in its spacious coast.

But lest some Zoilus blame my partial quill

Is blest hy peace, and peaceful pleasure still,

Under whose crown this isle erst cut in twain

Is now united, whose sweet voice affin-med

The universal world not to contain

By ¹ him whose critic pen partia] to none
Deferred the laurel to this house alone.

Knocked at the pole of honour, who, by fate
