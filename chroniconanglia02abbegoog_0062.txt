Of him and his ³ cu-partners, that they grant

A gentle audience. To them he impul-ts

The joys uf peace, the miseries which haunt
Bellona‘s tents, their honour fondly stain’d
Since they these wars against their prince maintain'd.

Moved with these words, and hnping other time
Wuuld give this happy plot a luokier birth,
York's warlike lord, whose mind on high did climb,
Fixing his seeming-humbled eyes on th’ earth,
Said thus ς -“ 1 take to witneffi God and man
“ That my sad heart was never joy'd with mirth
“Since Ι this troublous business first began :
“ But yet my country's good o’ersways my mind,
“ And tells me Ι for her some ease must find.

¹‘ I do not seek my prince’s life, nor ever
“ Intend his downfall3 let my sovereign reign
“ Tssl death un-king him z these my hands shall never
“ Lift sword against him, though my title's plain
“ As sprung from ¹ Clarence, Edward’s second son,
“ And York, the fourth. (My lord you know I feign
“ No bastard-title) yet my actions run
‘¹ In a far lower channel, I desire
“ The safety that our country doth require.
