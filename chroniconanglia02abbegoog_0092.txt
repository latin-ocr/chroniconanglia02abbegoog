But Oxford oweth thee yet more thanks 3 for thou
Byssthy fair college, built'st a school as fair,
And liberal maintenance dost to them allow
That o’er thy young grammarians take care.
Nor Oxford only, but the country swains ⁴
To thy magnificence beholding are,
Whose sons by thee good education gain
So wholly rent-free, that their fathers’ purse
For their instructing nothing doeh disburse.

Praise-worthy prelate, how thy deeds increase
And quite excel my new-born poetry !
Edward, (whose sceptre flourish’d now in peace
Wrapp'd with a gal-land of prosperity‚)
In solemn progress through his kingdom went
(Girt with fair troops οἱ his nobility)
Hath hither purposely his journey bent,

And, which is more, unask'd and unexpected.

Sti-angers unbidden seldom'st are neglectaed,

Here did he see that goz-genus house, whose §rame
Admits no equal. All the world entwin’d
In Amphitxite’s girdle, cannot name
A braver building. Edward’s noble mind
Admires the work, and in most gracious wise
Applauds the foundex's worth : and there did bind
His royal self always to patronise
