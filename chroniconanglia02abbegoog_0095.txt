Now Richmond's ssags strike up, and now fau dow113

Sometimes they press, and sometimes baokward go ·;

Belov’d “ Andates hovering o'er their head

With doubtful wing doth waver to and fro,

'Till Richard, mad to see his friends fan dead,
Breaks through his rival‘s rank to meet their lord,
Whom found‚bold Riehard falls byRichmond's sword.

Clap, clap your hands, you cherubims above
To see this tyrant's downfall ι you, whose blood
Shed by this tyrant parricide, do love
Thac pleasing word revenge, in joyful mood
Dance your sweet measureS‘, let the heavens rebound
Whose burning lamps have, half-extinguish'd, stood
Amazed to sue his nmrdors. Let all sound

A joyful triumph. Englaud, weep no more,

He's gone that lately purpled thee with gore.

Waynssete rejoice, see now thou mayst behold
Thy God-son well reveng'd, thy country free,
Thy patron's line restofflh for now tho gold
Adorns seventh Henry's princely head, and he,
Intending to establish lasting peace,
Marries ' Elizabeth, York's heir, Even she
By whom thus matoh'd intestine wars did cease,
And the two ¹⁰ rose-s which so long did jar,
Were now united in an amorous war,
