Came from Sabrina, who in times of old
Was ³ Locrine's daughter, borne by ⁴ Elstrid bright
His concubine: But ³ Guendoline his bold
And warlike wife, scorning that Humber’s brat
Should make Locrinus’ love to her grow cold,
Turns a deas ear to their life-begging chat,

And having kill'd her husband throws his child

And takes his rival captive and demands
How such a princox durst his prinne assail.

To see his blood sprinkling the earth, this thing
The crook—back'd Duke of Glo'ster' executes
And with a stab the noble prince salutes?
