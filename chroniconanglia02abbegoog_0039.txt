Than Rome’s first monarch2⁴ then the grey goose
And Bilboa blades well whet in many a war [wing
Slaughter‘d the Frenchf; Henry as in a sti-ing

Led Victory with him ς what he takes in hand

Prospers: Bellona was at his comand.

But Hem-y dieth, and Bedford, “ his brave brother,
Follows the wars begun with like success;
France lost one valiant foe, and finds another
Attended by like chance, like happiness ς
Under this Prince our Brereton fights‚ and gains
Etemal credit, having nothing less
Bestow‘d upon him for his forepast pains

Than Caen, the mother-city of that place ¹

From whence our Nonnan kings derive their race.

Then blistex'd be their tongues, that feign this man

To be a barber's ' offspring; let such thoughts

Be smother'd in their bosoms who began

To bruach this error; since they savour nought

But envy and detraction2 for the arms,⁴

Which th' Heralds (that with studious pains have

, To salve antiquity’s oblivious harms) [sought

Give to this House, which then so long had stood,
Proclaim him sprung from a true gentle blood.
