’ Exeter leaves the stage : ¹ his worthy brother,
Bedford’s great Duke follows; whose worthy deeds
’ No dark oblivion, no long time shall smother.
What our first English worthy had obtained,
And rent from ¹¹² Gaul’s great monareh, what this other
¹ Had with like magnanimity mfflntain’d,
Revolts to ¹ Charles of F rauce, and every coast
Was not so quickly won‚ but sooner lost.

Yet Gloster lived, and, while he lived, this realm
Kept France at work; but Hem-y's’ new-made wife
Disdain'd to see a subject sit at helm,
And he whom she called husband, lead a life

Hangs o'er thy head; the haughty Queen (loth vow

That thou from the Protectorshx'p remov'd,

Shalt not rule him whom she vouchsai'es t'have lov'd.
