ΜεΜοκιΑι ον WAYNFLETE. 33

“The Queen and Somerset neglect the state :

¹‘ France is regaiffd, and scol-ns the English swny ς

“ And all the fertile provinces, which late

“ Were subject to this crown, are fallen away*

“ They rule the mast: Our sovereign is misled

“ By them: the common people are a prey

“ To sycophants of theirs: We nobly bred
“ Must fawn to creatures of their making: now
“ The Royal blood to parasites must bow.

69.
“ If royal Henry in an open court
“ Letting me plead 'gainst Somerset, will defend
“ His favourite’s cause in just and noble sort,
¹‘ Here (worthy Prelate) shall my wars have end.
“ But if my liege avert his gentle ear
¹‘ From my complaint, (God willing‚) I intend
‘¹ To wreak my vongeance on that traitorous peer,
“ And sooner die than let him live to be
“ A plagae unto the people, state, and me.”

Waynflete receives this answer, and retires
To Henry's camp, who with it seems content.
Thus Waynssete’s meditatwn quenched the sires
Of civil discord. Cruel prisonment
Betides the Duke of Somerset till his day
Of trial carne* The hosts which lately meant
In hostile sort to sight a bloody fray
Arc reconcil·d; humeward they bend their pace,
And with all praise the worthy Prelate grace*
