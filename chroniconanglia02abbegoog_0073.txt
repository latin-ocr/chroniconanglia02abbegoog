And make resistance 'gainst an army's might.

And, ere our valour-murdering guns were found,

Did well perform that charge3 for I dare write

Might have maintain'd it ‘ gainst a kingdom's wrong.

Within this wall is placed a beauteous grove
Like Pindus, where the sacred muses dwell,
Or like th' Epirian woods in which great Jove
Nurs‘d hy Melissus’ gracious girls did dwell.
Here nought doth want to furnish reereation,
The studious scholar here may study well.
Mars, and the muses here have habitation.
Here are both walks to meditate, and places
To exercise one's mind in warlike graces,

The swist-wing'd arrow, which such slaughter made
In France, hath here butts to be levell¹d at.
The heavy bar here sometimes as a slade
Is foon-pitch’d off, and like a massy bat
Whirl'd o'er the head, divides the foggy air,
Here do they leap, and leaping verberate
The yielding earth; here many men repair

Their sickly bodies, and herein do find

By conference contentment to the mind.

This is both Campus Magius, to augment
Our bodies’ strength with valorous exercise,
And Tempe, skudious scholars to content
