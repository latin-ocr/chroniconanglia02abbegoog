Mammam οε WAYNFLETE. 51

With spots of insamy. The pious king

Is in the hurly-burly prisoner ta’en,

Whom York in glad sort doth to London bring,
Where ’tis ordained that he the king shall keep ς
So to the wolf committed is the sheep.

Our second voada seornes that her mate
Δ Thus should be curb‘d 2 and by her power removes

The Yorkish lord from ruling of the state

In scornful wiser, and now it him behoves

For all his wrongs to seek his last redress3

And eries aloud that he who best him loves

Should help him now 1 how shall my pen express
These troublous times, in which the god of war
Trampled down thousands with his brazen car.

1 18.
York ssies to Ireland, but brave Warwick stays,
And where the river Neue doth smoothly glide [strays
Through th’ North-Hamptonian fields, and calmly
’Till by North-Hammon walls his waves do slide,
He pitch'd his tents3 and makes a solemn vnw
That he all human turture will abide
Rather than to queen Margaret's empire hoW.
Who like Bellona with her ssags display‘d,
Heart’neth her true-styl‘d subjects to her aid.
