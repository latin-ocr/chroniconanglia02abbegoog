As Enoch, Adam, and Methusalem. .
The heavens enclose thy soul, thy corpse the grave,
Let us thy ‘name from dark oblivium save.

Emmaus.

Thus VVaynflete liv'd, and thus did Waynssete eud,
Who yet shall never end, for whilst the mn,
Plac‘d in his flaming eoach, his 'work intends,
And makes his fiery-footed jades to run
About yon crystal cieling ς whilst the light
That gilds our dark nights ‘ scapes confusion,
So long shall Waynssete live, and ssourish bright

To all posterity, and be accounted ·

Α man most absolute, by none surmounted.
