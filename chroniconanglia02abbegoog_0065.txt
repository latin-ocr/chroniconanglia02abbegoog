That royal house, whose Church¹ 1 well may name
The world's eighth wonder, (if so fame imparts
Nought but the truth.) 1 never saw the srame

Of this brave building, nor can my pen sit

That model which excels all poet's wit.

The scholars were elected, whose behaviour

Did first direct itself ς but faults soon spring

Where statutes want3 sith every one will favour

His proper doings : so the prudent king

Allots our Waynssete to that weighty charge,

By statutes and good ordinance to bring

Them in some bounds who first did live at large,
He makes, puts out, amends, and takes such care,
Good laws soon made, and bad abolish'd are.

The place ¹ whereof thou once hads’t been the head
Requires like reformations ς thou before
Didst govern by thy wisdom, but now led
By his command, whom thou didst honour more
Thau he whose bark, tossed on the briny wave,
Now free from death, honours the weleome shore,
Thy sound directions and good laws did save

That house from error⁴ She receiv'd from thee

The laws which yet she keeps so firmly free.

But Eton ow'th thee morZGthan this. The work
