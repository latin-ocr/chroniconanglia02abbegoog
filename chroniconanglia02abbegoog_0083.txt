By loud-mouth'd fame, arm'd now with double wing,
Is certified of his great foes deeaying,
And posts for England ; but the warlike queen
Penthesilea—like, “ her foes dismaying,
Met him where Calder brook, a river slxeen,
Stays by fair Wakefield 3 there they battles join,
And deaths are sold for honour, not for coin.

Fortune moves retrograde, York’s mounting spirit
F ate-shacde, falls before his female foe.
Young ³ Rutland, murder’d for his father's merit,
With Salisbury, new slain by fatal blow,
Swims in his blood to find his father's ghost,
And to th’ Elysian fields together ga
The warlike Amazon clears every coast,

And alliu solemn march together make

The air to tremble, and the earth to quake.

But Edward, ¹⁶ York’s first son, is hard at hand

With a huge army, which doth daunt the pride

Of the erest-fall’n virago, whose command

Govern'd the true Lancastrians; and beside

Towton, a village small, the {rumpets sound

A dreadful joining. Cruel soldiers dyed

Their ravenous blades in gore; the stupid ground
Her once smooth cheeks, war-furrowed now, did stain
With blood of seven aud thirty thousand slain,

ι mina pellit, Penthesilea furem»
