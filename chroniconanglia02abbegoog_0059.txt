Mamortha 01² Wnnnn'rz. 29

Kept the state warm, he durst not touch the aim

At which in heart he shot; thy timeless death

Sets ope the floodgates of his hopes, and gives

Free passage to his torrenta the fair wreath

Is plainly hunted asten Margaret lives
Hated, and ¹¹¹ Somerset her new made minion
Is uf the subjects had in bad opinion.

Now York triumphs, and by his crafty plats
Stirs up the commons to maintain a host
Against their Snvereign. Lo, the clownish sots
Obey his hosts. Rude ¹ Cade iius all the coasts
Oi Kent with επακ plough—shares ase turned to billa,
Sheep-honks to lances. His vain-glorious boam
Promise unm the valiant golden hills.

Their army, like a long-cours'd river grows,

That makes his banks wider, the farther't ssows.

Thus plough they up their mothel-'s breasts, and march
By Isis’ current ’till their army came
To the King's ¹ Chamber-royal where the arch
Which cuts the flood denies the furious flame
Α further passage. Now they swell with tage
And are resolved the ssoating waves to tame
And bridge it with a rank οἱ ships; T’assuage
These tumults Henry musters up his men
Το drive these rustic swads to plough again.
