Or walk, and talk, and certainly deserve
Abundant praise; but I must dedicate
My muse to other matters3 yet will say
Since Bullen's-Victor's rage did minate
England‘s fair abbeys, to this very day
They want co-partners, and must stand alone,
Unmatch'd, unparallell’d by any one.

This buildings inward wall, which doth behold

The goodly quadrangle, is strongly drest

With fair and stately pillars, which uphold

Rare hieroglyphics, in which are express’d

Mysterles worthy marking, which as now

Few can to any grounded meaning wrest.

A misery‚ that such mysteries should bow
Under oblivion's yoke ; but time prevails
'Bove all, when man and man’s invention fails.

Into this quadrangle with spacious lights
Looks a fair library, which Waynflete fill'd
With full eight hundred books. They which did write
Best in what tongue soever, it nought skill'd,
Were there laid up. This place enlarg'd, requires
Of some praise—worthy man to be upheld
In its due estimation, and desires
That some as benefactors at their charge
The number of its volumes would enlarge.
