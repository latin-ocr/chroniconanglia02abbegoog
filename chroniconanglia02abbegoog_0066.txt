Not ended by the king, receiv'd of thee
A full perfection ; and lest truth should Iurk
Hid in the darkness of antiquity,
The ancient writer, Leland‚'¹ will deciate,
Whose words our late assertion verify.
Resides Commemorations duiy are
Observ'd for thee at Eton, as the man
Which brought’st to end that work the king began,

Who wisely weighing the mortality

Of sickiy men, did healthful m'ake his will,

In which our Waynssete <whose fidelity

Unto his sovereign made him trusted still)

Was made executor; with this cantion

And grave advice, the fore-made motion
Should quite be void. If doubt hereos you move,
His παλμγγενεσίι will it prove!

Inci‘eased his favour with his sovereign so
That were he more deserv'd, or more were lov'd
May to a doubtful controversy grow.
His Counsel was an oracle, from whom
Such politic complotments still did flow,
That Henry charg'd he never should be from
