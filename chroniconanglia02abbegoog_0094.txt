Had put on wolfishness, and lost the name
Of man, God‘s image. His inhuman facts
ln which he glutting, surfeited at last
Brought double vengeance for all murder past,

Hem-y uf Richmond,⁸ Lancaster's sole heir,

Who from his infancy an exile was,

And could not safely breathe his native nir,

From little Britain's chalky rocks did pass

With an indifferent navy. To his aid

Whole nations floek in troops. The brittle glass

Of fawning fortune breaks. Richard dismay‘d
With these unlook‘d-for news, inwardly droops,
But outwardly cheers up his faintiug troops.

Mark how the English drum soumis, blood and death
The battles join, and as the foaming wave
Flows up curl-pnted Humber, (whose fierce brenth
Tottering whole navies grimly do out-brave
Their wooden ribs) and by a violent force
Doth make him seem another way to have,
Breaking the current of his natural course,

Yet, when the tide is spent, ssies back again,

And pays large tribute to the watery main.

So did this battle, hard by ⁷ Bosworth town;
Now Richard had the better, now his foe ς
