Alas! how few in these our Halcyon days

Take patronage of these afflicted wights.

Well may a poet‘s works deserve the bays,

And yet be counted frivolous, vain, and slight.

Nay, be they counted good, what's their reward 2

Some cold commendings : what a grievous plight

By a purg'd ear, and we shall see these men,
Now set at nought, will ssourish green again.

Which Pegasus' swift hoof did make, nor ever
Slept on that twmtopp’d mountain, where the ships.
