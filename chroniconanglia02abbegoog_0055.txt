ΜεΜοιιιΑι οῖ WAYNFLETE. 25

Paid for their lives, made many worthy knights
To leave their country to these barbaruus wights.

Amungst them one Emanuel, whose estate

Maintain'tl him once a knight, for succour flies

Tu England; his escape was fortunate3

He met with Waynflete, who, with watery eyes,

Griev'd at the loss that Christendnm sustain'd,

Heard his discourse. pitied his miseries,

The Grecians' case and cause they told, obtain'd
ι Α yearly pension fur him, by the which

He might live honestly, but not so rich.

But these were private benefits3 his mind
Intends a public favour to this land,
As yet the Muses wandex'd, and could find
Few testing places; he with open haud
Protests his love tu them, and ’gins to raise
A habitatiun for them, which should stand
Tin it might see the eye-out-staring rays
Of Phoebus dim‘d, pale Cynthia wanting light,
And all things hurried in perpetual night.

The ground is bought, the King's good leave is gotten
And now the work begins on high to rear
His advanc'd head with state ; ¹⁰ when lo! the rotten
And corrupt English members brought a fear
