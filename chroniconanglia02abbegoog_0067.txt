His royal palace3 where he ready found
A yearly pension of two hundred pouud,

79.
Yet greater honours are bestow'd2 for see
He is created Chancellor, which place
Obtains next to the King the first degree.
In this he found among the people grace.
He pardons small offenders, and relieves
Such as lay groaning under th’ heavy mace
Of dire oppression ·, he kind succour gives
To them whom need o'erwhelm'd, and evermore
Was as a sanctuary to the poor.

80.
And now the work which he of late begun
Calls for perfectiom but his mind is set
Upon a braver building; thus undone
He Ieft the former, and lest aught should let
His good proceedings, royal Hem-y gave
That hospital ¹ which he whom th’ wars did fret
Made by his angry barons, nigh the wave
Of smooth-paced Chal-well for the poor did frama,
And call'd it by the King his father's name.

Waynfleoe by this εηοοιπῗὲὲᾱ, sets his thought
Wholly upon his building, which now threats
The middle sky, built of hewn stone being brought
