40 Pan-:R Hmuu's

Lie pleasant walks rear'd from the low-laid ground
Down on th'one side the buhbling flood doth sink,
Whose parted stream doth quite encompass round
This place of pleasure, and thus gliding on
The rugged stones doth make a murmuring sound,
And to raise up more delectation

The scaly people living there at ease

Danae in the crystal waters what they please.

88,

On th'other side a pleasant mead is plac'd,

Enriched with Flora‘s verdant tapestry,

With all scent-pieasing ssowers most sweessy graced,

Which are not art's bur nature's nursery.

The primrose sweet, cowslip of pleasant hue,

The daisy, which with secret sympathy

Opes and shuts with the day's eye, here we view.
And such as these, that with dumb eloquenee
Of fragrant sweetness captivate the sense.

89.

The walks themselves are compass'd round about
With thick-set trees, which clad in summer's pride
Admit no entry to the winds 3 keep out
The ehill-cold air, and also bravely hide
With out-stretch’d boughs the heaven ; so that the ruys
Of Phoebus, who on's prancing steeds doth ride
Thrnugh the twelve monsters dwelling in his ways,
Lose all their scorching beat, and only give
A gentle warmth, in which no heat doth live.
