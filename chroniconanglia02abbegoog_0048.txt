18 Fama Hanm's

Till heat and cold, moist natures, and things dry
Shall in one heap confus’d together lie.

29.
But such authorities through every Realm
Peter’s successui-s in the Roman chair
Had now usurp'd, that none must rule the helm
Of a Church-living, but must make repair
To them for confirmation. The then Pope ³
Mov'd with the briefs, full οἰ words smooth and fair,
Made by the Convent‚ gave what they did hope
They should not be denied, and by his voice
His Holiness confirm’d the convent's choice.

30.
Of all Rome’s priestly monarchs, he that then
Govern'd that ancient city, by consent
Of their now—writers (whose corrupted pen
chiefly commends the living) was most bent
To pious com-ses. He reform‘d the bad,
Confirm'd the good; his aim and whole intent
Was with rewards to make the virtuous glad
That they that course of life had undertook,
And vice's beaten path-ways had forsook.

This Pope (a thing which Rome but seldom knew)
In giving offiees respected more

The person than his wealth3 he (strange yet true),
Rich knaves put by, preferr'd the honest poor

Into the Magistracy ; his free hand
