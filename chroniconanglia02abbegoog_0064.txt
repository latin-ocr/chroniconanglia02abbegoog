34 PETER Hmmm's

71.

Then in that temple which the Kentish king,
Good ¹ Ethelhert, to ¹ Paul did dedicate,³
Whose lofty top, tiring an eagle's wing
To touch, ⁴ a lightning ssash did minate,
The northern Duke (our Waynflete standing by)
Took God to witness he would consecrate
His future days to Henry‘s majesty.

Now hell-bred discord in this land did cesse,

Daub'd over by a counterfeited peace⁴

72.
And in this time of peace was bom a son
To England‘s picus monarch. Waynflete dips
The infant in the sacred font. This done
He names him Edward, whose sweet smirking lips
Attracted all beholders· eyes away.
Time, having nought his ssight to hinder, skips ς
The prince grows manly, and the sacred day
Is come in which the prince, coniirm'd, doth orave
Waynssete as surety οἳ his saith to have.

King Henry then had with great charges rais’d
In England’s other nursery of arts,

Than which <except her sister) none is prais'd
So much in foreign nations for rare parts,

(1) The lssth King us Kent from Hengist, And [he ht christened King
or the Suom.

(2) ιι had been the zen-plu os nm grem goddo„ mana.

(³) Anno 61⁰. (⁴) Anno 1460.
