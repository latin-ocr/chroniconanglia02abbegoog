Amidst their boughs the birds do build their nest,
And hopping round, with pretty warbling strains
Delight the ear. The Ν ightingale, whose rest
Is on a thom, of Tereus here complains.
The sweet-vuic'd thrush and blackbird here do make
Their chirping tunes3 the linnet with sweet pains
Lisps out his note: the pretty lark deth quake

His slender voice 3 and all so sweessy sing,

As if this place were a perpetual spring.

Kissing the stanes, the counter-tenor blaze3
And lest one part were wanting, here we find
Minerva’s honey-birds buzzing the base.

Au things in one so sweessy do consent

To give the walkers a complete content.
