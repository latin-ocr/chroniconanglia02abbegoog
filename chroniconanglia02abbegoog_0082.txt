His Chaucellorship to Henry in his tent,
Andleaves the field. From hence the world combines
To slander him, as one that leaves his lord,
When dangerous war his person round entwines ·,
And with a barking tongne, and biting word,

Accuse him as unconstant, and unkind

To him, whom he so gracious still did find.

But Henry knew his faith, and to the Pope
Clear‘d him from all suspicion, as a man
Thau whom no poteritate could ever hope
A better counsellor. The morn began
To ope her dusky eyes, and crow-blaek night
To Tenarus her sad pavilion ran ;
And now the armies join3 the bloody sight
Continues 'tin the sun had climb‘d the sky,
And from the eastern dales touch'd mountains high.

Here did the father sight against his seed·,
And they that erst were link'd in friendship's knot
Bandy against each other blows, and 'ieed
The earth with lnke-warrn blood. The angry Scot
Runs madding through the field, and dips his blado
In Yorkshire blood, whose purple streams do blot
The sable earth. But Warwick's sword soon made
A passage through their troops, (oh dismal chance Ι)
His scarlet steed on carcases doth prance.

The day is his. The Quleii'retires. The King
Is taken prisoner. York in Ireland staying
