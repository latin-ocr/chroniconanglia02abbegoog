Mammam OF WAYNPLETE. 61

ξ( Will score etei-nal lashes on thy side ·,
“ Else hell-born hags, whose iron whips do steep
‘¹ Themselves with poison, will o’erthrow thy pride.
“ Else will the Manes οἱ these heroes slain
‘¹ nance their blank rounds about thee, aud bestride
“ Thy wretched ccx-pse, to thy eternal pain.
“Gloster, iament, the angry heavens ιο please,
“ Waynssete, lament, and hate entiaing ease.''

Thus Waynflete mourus3 and royal Edward strives
To comfort him, and with all princely love
Into the worthy prelate's bosom dives,
To ease that beart, whose grievous plaints might move
The ruthless stenes. To him hc doth confirm
The ancient privileges which behove
A bishop’s place and prosim as affirm

His letters patent, cited in that book ³

Which to revive this man first undertook.

And more t’express his bounty, he ordain'd
Wflynflete fair Oxford’s Chancellor ; which place
Was by his aid in its due worth maintain'd.
For the Foundation, which so much deth grace
Humphrey of Gloster, the true favourcr
Of learned men and learning, doth embrace
Waynflete as its most complete finisher.

I mean that School, in which divine assertions

Are purified from all impure aspersions.
