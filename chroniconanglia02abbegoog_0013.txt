It is remarkable that the Mennim, which is here
published for the first time from a manuscript in
Heylin’s own handwriting preserved in the Library
of Magdalen College, Oxford, has escaped the notice
of all his Biographers⁴ lt was probably written soon
after the Death of Queen Anne, which is alluded to
in stanza 107, and which mournful event took place
on the an of March, A. ι). 1619, the very year in
which the author was admitted perpetual fellow of
Magdalen College. The notes with one or two
exeeptions are given from the MS.

Notwithstanding the excellent Notice and Republi-
cation of Barnard’s Life of Heylyn in the lst volume
of his History of the Reformation, lately edited for

’ the Ecclesiastical History Society by Mr Robertson, 1
have deemed that it would not be unacceptable to
the Readers of the MEMORIAL to give them here
certain Extracts ‘¹ out of an account οἱ Dr Heylyn's
life written by himself to April 8th, 1645,” copied by
Anthony Wood from the original MS„ which, he
mentions, was lent him by Mr Henry Heylyn of
Minster Lovell, Sth July 1673* Mr Robertson alludes
to these memoranda (Introductory notice xxv), but
does not appear to have consulted the copy of them,
which may be found among Wond’s MSS. (E. 4.) in

the Ashmolean Museum, (gxford.
