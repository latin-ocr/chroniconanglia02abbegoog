MEMORIAL οἰ anum. 23

Not elevated by these dignities, which even
Made him ador’d and honour'd. All his thought
Was to please Him, from Whom all this was given,
To Whom he owed his breath. He chiefly sought
To be beloved of all, and largely gave,
That he the poor’s good wishes so might have.

He knew his riches were on him bestow'd
To relieve others’ wants, he knew the end
Of his preferment·, that his wealth was owed
By him which made and doth the world defend.
He only was a steward tu disburse
With liberal hand what God to him did send,
So to be given ε his house, his hand, his purse,
Is open to the poor, and what he can
Turns to the profit of {he poorer man.

So, ere he died, his bounty was made known
Most eminent. There was no Monk nor Friar
In Winehester’s fair abbey, but was grown
Wealthy by him. And he (besides their hire)
Was to his servants so munificent,
That some ssed Knight—high, other some soar'd higher ε
To Wykeham's scholars so magnificent,
That all had cause to praise that worthy Peer
Tu whom they always were accounted dear.

He in his house continuali} did breed
Six learn‘d Divines, with whom he spenthis days
