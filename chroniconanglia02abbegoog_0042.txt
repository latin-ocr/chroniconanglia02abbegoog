12 PETBR ΗιιγιιΝέ

By Ethics we discen. the bad from good;

If we are rich, this teacheth us to use

Our riches with discretim, lest our food

And vain apparel should these gifts misuse3

If we are poor, we want it much to ease

Our hearts with patience, lest we should abuse

His Name, that gave such blessings unto these
And not to us: by this all rnen thongh rude
Are wrapp'd in robes of pure heatitude.

To know and not to do deserves great shame,
To do a thing once known (ff good) great praise,¹
To do, and not know what, nor why, great blame,
To know what ’tis we do and why, the bays.
Young Patten then coupled them both in one,
Knowledge with action; and they two did raise
Their joiner from his College to a Throne.
Knowledge is best, when we it actify,
And they are firmliest good, that best know why.

15.
To know, and not be able to express
Our knowledge, is nought worth3 to do good deeris
And tell no reason why, is little less
Than vanity ; to know, and do, we need
Speech to express our minds, that we may shew
A reason for our actions, and, indeed,
Impart unto our friends what things we know ·, ¹
