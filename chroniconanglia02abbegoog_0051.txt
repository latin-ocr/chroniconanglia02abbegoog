ΜΕΜοιῑιΑι, OF WAYNrm-a. 21

37.

Then let it no discredit he accountod
That Waynflete by a Pope coniirm’d his place,
Since he his predeeessors so surmounted
Nought hence can Waynssete’s memory deface.
He is confirm’d, and solemnly created
By Canterbury, whose Hierarchic place
Him to that sacred office deputatcd.

Never was Bishop welcom'd to his See

With more solemnity or pomp than he,
This See (though not the highest in place, yet thought
The greatest in revenues) hath alone
Two privileges, which may well be sought
In other seeS, but never found. The one
Is that the Bishops are the Chancellors
Of Canterbury's Primate, in whose throne
By death made void, they sit as Counsellors;

So that by them as Vicars of the Chair

Our English Kings sometimes anointed are.

39.

The other is ς the. Prelates are ordain'd
Of that brave order which such credit brings
Unto this realm, in that it hath obtain’d
Eight Emperors, twenty—two foreign Kings,
Twenty strange Dukes, as fellows to the Knights
That England breeds. The Garter ¹ deck’d with rings
And costly jewels, which the eye delights,

Tied round the leg with gem-bedecked loops,

Is the chief ensign oi these sacred troops.
