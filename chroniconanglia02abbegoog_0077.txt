There lies he with his mother: who, alas!
Grieving to lose her dearest, dearest son,
Through the Heavens’ tenfoltl brazen doors did pass,
And hangs about his sacred neck ι run, run,
You heavenly citizens, to view this greeting,
Your whirling spheres another moon have won.
stand all amazed to see this moui-niul meeting,
And let the water dropping from your eyes
Quench Phoebus‘ lamp, and sable all the skies.

This royal prince, sad Magdaien’s best hope.
Was by her entertain'd3 his grace did call
Her house his own, and, (which is now my scope)
His princely person supp'd within her hall,
And made each scholar of the house put on
Their corneffd caps, and minding now that au
Should know his bounty, he lays hold upon
A goblet foaming with the grape's sweet wealth,
And to great Waynflete's scholars dn‘nks a health.
