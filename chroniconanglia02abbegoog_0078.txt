Heroic soul! how shall my rhymes express
This seld-seen bounty. Were my foolish quill
Dipp'd ιἰι the Heliconian fount, yet less
Would be described than thou deserv’st 3 yet still
My soul shall honour thy dead memory,
And future times admira thy great good will
Which thou hast shewn to us. Posterity

Shall weep thy loss, and know that they lament

Therein their own bad luck, sad drean'ment.

The work is done, and Waynflete doth retire
To Henry's palace, where his faithful beart
Glads his afflicted prince. For now the sire
Of civil discord and intestine smart,
Which long had worn the mfisk of arnity,
Flames plainly forth, and spreads through every part
Of pious Henry's sea-clipp'd monarchy.
York claims the crown again by hostile arms,
And fresh supply unto him daily swarms.

Paint out, my muse, fairlgelece's sacred rays
Disfigur'd by uncivil civil wars. ¹
The fierce Pharsalian fields were gentle frays
