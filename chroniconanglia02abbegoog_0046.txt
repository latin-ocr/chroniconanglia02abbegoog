The benefit their youth reap’d in that piace
Where such have sway, or envious dolts that fret
Their beart-stringe at another man’s good luck,
Or else illiterate cluwns, whose duuness yet
From such a fruitful tree no fruit could pluck.
Fur learning, gratitude, or charity
Could never broach so vile an infamy.

24.

Waynflete pefform'd his charge with guod applause,
And made the king admira his house to see
Flourish so soon, in scholam and good laws:
And all by Waynflete's means, who, like the Bee
Brought huney to his hive, and made the heaven
Richer by many sou1s; and since that he
Did merit more than had as yet been given,

The pinus King, his studious care to grace,

Made him the Provost of that worthy place.

¹ May thy bones rest in peace, religious Prince,
Whose gracious love this famous man did raise
To such great honmus, that we, ever since,
Obliged to thee for him, must give thee praise.
’Twas not enough, thou thought'st, to make him head
Where he had been afoot3 thy virtue lays
A greater charge upon him ς thou wast led

By his advice; for thou didst him create

A privy Counsellor to the English state.
