The state affairs; all his endeavour was

To meditate on Heaven ⁴, he still affected

The cowl more than the crown, and therefore ’gan

(That his sost nature might be more respecbed)

To build fair schools, in which the poorer man
Might have his children taught with studious pains
Rem-free, yet great should be the teacher's gains.

The work is done. Eton her school doth raise3
And now religious Henry’s chiefest care
Is to find out some man that might with praise
Govem the school, and studiously prepare
The tendet minds of youth to take in hand
Church or state business. Some are sought, and are
Not well approv'd, so that the sole command
Of that fair school is void, and Waynflete's fame
Pointed him out to moderate the same.

“ ¹ Tis base to teach a school.'’ Base Gull, thy tongue

Breathes a blaok slander ’gainst authority.

Is’t not a credit to instruct the young?

To correct nature and inform the mind 7

To new-mould thern that in the world were flung

By nature wretched and by ignorance blind Τ
Το tame wild manners? and to teach the suul
How she her subject passions may control Ἰ
