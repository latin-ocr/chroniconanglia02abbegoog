Mammam OF Wnnnsm. 57

Had drench’d his foam-bedabbl’d jades Γ th' west,
And grim-fac’d night in her dark arms did wrap
This earthly football with a thick-black veil
Manfflng it round, and with a cIoudy cap
Huodwink'd the heavens, whose flaring lamps did fail
To spread their beams on this terresnial globe,
wholly extinguish'd by night’s hellish roba

133,

When Henry, safely kept in London tower,

Who not long since was happy England's head,

(His soul committed to the Suprema Power)

Sweetly reposing on his princely bed

Was by this tyrant Gloster (whose delight

Was with gere-blood to make his dagger red)

Stabb'd to the heart3 his now-triumphing spirit, ¹
Freed from his eartffly pn'son, gladly ssies
With higher wings up to the azure skies.

134.

Dark night, thou mother of annoyance sad,

Daughter of Chaos, wife to Erebus,

Sister to Lethe, th’ all Creator had

No need of thee3 his works so glorious

Thou dost deface ⁶, true noble hearts abhor

Thy ugly looks and visage tenebrous ;

Only th’ art by the slothful hunted sor,
Whose lazy limbs and beser minds do call
Thee nature’s hand-maid that refreshest all.

(a) Anno ἔξω.
