Chant out, my Musei in thy most pleoeing sti-nin,
That worthy Prelate’s fasne, whose stately denda,
Worthy so hrave a man, will still remain,
In spite of mineus time, though time exceeds
Her former strength and age3 whose worthy acts,
Fitting so grave a peer, admiring breeds
In all beholderm study, Muse ! to track
His footsteps: stt-ive to b1aze abroad his nme,
Whose virtues merit everlasting fame.

What I reoeiv'd Ι write; Waynssete shall owe
Nothing to my invention ·, truth zeems hest

In its own garments and apparel, though
Homely and plain ; and in such gannents drest
I shew her here, stripp’d from that Latin tire-¹
In which her beauties were so well expresst

By him, who snatch’d this ratique from the fite,
